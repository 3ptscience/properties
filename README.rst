This package uses meta-classes to define structure and expected behavior for
properties. These properties can be simple strings, numbers, vectors, arrays, etc.
Everything is documented!

Why Properties?
---------------

Giving structure (and documentation!) to the properties you use in your
code avoids confusion and allows users to interact flexibly and provide
multiple styles of input, have those inputs validated, and allow you as a
developer to set expectations for what you want to work with.
